SimpleSATc v1.0
=================================================================

This program is a simple SAT solver using the DPLL algorithm.
It was developed by Matthew Markwell for use by Shivam Malhotra
   at Purdue University.

To compile, type "make". To run, type "./SimpleSATc filename.cnf"
   where filename.cnf is an input file in DIMACS Conjunctive
   Normal Form.  The result of the computation is appended to
   the file "SimpleSATc.out", which displays either UNSATISFIABLE
   if the cnf has no solution, or SATISFIABLE as well as a
   satisfying variable assignment if a solution does exist.

The parser for this SAT solver was copied with permission from
   MiniSat-C v1.14.1
